# Serenity Springs Lodge

The Serenity Springs Lodge Management Tool is a project undertaken at the Turing School of Software and Design. The objective is to build a comprehensive hotel management tool catering to both hotel customers and management. The tool facilitates the management of room bookings and the calculation of customer bills, aiming to streamline the hotel's operations and enhance user experience.

## Challenges

One of the hardest challenges I faced was trying to finish this project plus all of the stretch goals in time. This project covers a lot of conceptsâ€”accessibility, testing, functionality, design, etc. Trying to get everything in a good spot in only a week was a big order.

## Wins
- Further demonstration of working with API fetch calls and asynchronous operations.
- Self teaching and adding CSS animations. 
- Building a robust testing suite that tests pure functions, along with happy and sad paths.
